Endo-repair

A small browser-based utility used to help Endomondo tracks
that suffered from shitty smartphone GPS modules.

You can try it out here:
http://kral.hk/endo-repair/

Usage: export a TCX file from Endomondo,
load it into endo-repair, edit,
save and import back to Endomondo.


It works entirely in browser and on client side only,
except for Google maps material.

Nothing guaranteed, might not even work, it's really very simple.
